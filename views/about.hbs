                        <p>
                            I developed an interest in programming at a young age since it gave me the ability to construct nearly whatever I wanted. After learning this, I realized I wanted to make my passion for programming more than simply a pastime.

                            Although I've never been particularly interested in the UI's appearance, I've always like working with the back end and creating the logic that allows my program to function as it must. As long as the logic is sound, I have no issues with the UI.
                        </p>

                            Since starting WEB322, I've learned to value and strive for things' appearance. It has also piqued my interest in attempting to connect the front end and back end so they can function together. I can only hope that this course will continue to teach me new things and provide me with more amazing experiences.
